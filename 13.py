# This code starts by playing just a few games, showing you the cards
# so that you can evaluate the computer's decisions.  After that, the
# code simulates 1000 games so that you can evalute the algorithm.
#
# Note that you can change the number of sample games, the number of
# simulations run, and so on.  Just adjust the correct variable in the
# block of definitions immediately below this note.
