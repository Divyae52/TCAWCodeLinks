#
# Using what we know about TicTacToe, can you finish writing the
# code to play Connect Four? You will want to replace my playRandomly()
# function with new versions of whatHappens() and findBestMove().
#
# Note that this version of the program joins a game that is almost
# finished.  Once your code works, remove a few checkers from that
# starting board and see what happens. How much slower is the code
# when the number of choices increases? Be careful; your computer might
# crash if you give it a fully blank board.
